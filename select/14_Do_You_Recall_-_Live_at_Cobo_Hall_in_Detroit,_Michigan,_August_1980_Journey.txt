Do you recall, that lonely summer day?
We were together and things got in our way

Well, so you think that it's all over
And you know it's gone to stay
Oh oh, after stormy weather
Does the sun shine every day?

Yes, I recall, the things you said that day
You told me that you were leavin'
'Cause we can't go on this way

Oh, so you think that it's all over
And you know it's gone to stay
Oh oh, after stormy weather
Does the sun shine every day?

Yes, it's the lovin' things
That keeps us wondering
Yes, it's the lovin' things
Ooh, baby, love

Girl, it's the lovin' things
That keep us wonderin'
Yes, it's the lovin' things
Ooh, girl, say you'll stay

You think that it's all over
And you know it's gone to stay
Oh oh, after stormy weather
Does the sun shine every day?

Well, so you think that it's all over
And you know it's gone to stay
Oh oh, after stormy weather
Does the sun shine every day?

Does the sun shine every day?
No no
