Party people got yourself a recall
Party people got yourself a recall
Party people got yourself a recall
Party people come to party y'all
Party people got yourself a recall
Party people come to party y'all

Get up, come down to the gig
Take my cake, come on, make me big
Make my day till returns the night
Blow the way 'cause I feel all right
He hits the night showing off the stuff
Make yourself out like I can't get enough
Shake it up before the night is done
Get on down and let's have fun

Everybody come and see
What to do, how to be
Me for you, you for me
You come to party

Everybody move along
You no wrong, stand as tall
Here's another techno song
You come to party

Party people
Get the sound of a recall
Party people
Come to party y'all

Party people
Get the sound of a recall
Party people
Come to party y'all

Yes y'all you're having a ball
Go blow the horn and sound the recall
Spread the word from here to Timbuktu
Have you heard its comin' through
Right left from back up down
You party all around town
All of the party people get busy
Party harty till you get dizzy

Party people
Got yourself a recall
Party people
Come to party y'all

Party people
Got yourself a recall
Party people
Come to party y'all

Everybody gonna see
What to do, how to be
Before you, before me
Come to party

Everybody move along
You no wrong, stand as tall
Here's another techno song
You come to party

Come along, come along
Come along, come along
Come along, come along
Come along, come along

Party people
Got yourself a recall
Party people
Come to party y'all

Party people
Got yourself a recall
Party people
Come to party y'all

Everybody gonna see
What to do, how to be
Before you, before me
Come to party

Everybody move along
You no wrong, stand as tall
Here's another techno song
You come to party
